# Privacy Policy for Math Trainer

**Last Updated:** June 28, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Minimal ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Minimal's Math Trainer mobile application (the "App").

Your privacy is important to us. Our policy is simple: we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information.

### 1. Information We Do Not Collect

Minimal's Math Trainer is designed to be a completely anonymous experience. We do **not** collect any personally identifiable information (PII), including but not limited to:

*   Your name, email address, or phone number
*   Your location or GPS data
*   Your device's advertising identifier (IDFA) or any other unique device identifiers
*   Any data from your contacts, photos, or other apps on your device
*   Any usage analytics or telemetry about your interaction with the app

There are no user accounts to create, no login screens, and no connection to any social media platforms.

### 2. Locally Stored Data (High Scores)

The only data the App saves is your game performance, specifically your high scores for different game configurations (difficulty, operation, and time limit).

This information is stored **only on your own device** using its native storage capabilities (`AsyncStorage`). This data is never transmitted to us or any third party. It remains on your device for the sole purpose of allowing you to track your own progress. If you delete the app, this data is deleted as well.

### 3. Children's Privacy

The App is designed to be safe for all ages, including children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any such information, we are compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

### 4. Third-Party Services

We use the Expo framework to build and maintain the App. Expo does not collect any personal data through our implementation of their framework. The App does not contain any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
